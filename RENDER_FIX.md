# Quick Fix for Render Deployment

## The Problem
Your Render deployment was failing because:
1. The React app wasn't being built during deployment
2. The server was looking for `/frontend/build/index.html` which didn't exist
3. API calls were hardcoded to `localhost:5000`

## The Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Build Process
- Updated `package.json` with proper build scripts
- Created `build:frontend` script that installs dependencies and builds React app
- Added proper environment handling

### 2. Fixed API Configuration
- Created `frontend/src/config/api.ts` for environment-aware API URLs
- Updated all components to use dynamic API URLs
- Removed hardcoded `localhost:5000` references

### 3. Updated Server Configuration
- Added proper static file serving with error handling
- Updated CORS settings for production
- Added build directory existence check

### 4. Render Configuration
- Created `render.yaml` for Infrastructure as Code deployment
- Updated build and start commands

## Steps to Deploy on Render

### Option 1: Update Your Existing Service

1. **Update Build Command in Render Dashboard:**
   ```
   npm run build:frontend
   ```

2. **Update Start Command:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```


4. **Redeploy:**
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"

### Option 2: Create New Service (If needed)

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. New â†’ Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Use these settings:
   ```
   Name: prysm
   Environment: Node
   Build Command: npm run build:frontend
   Start Command: npm start
   ```

## Verification

After deployment, you should see:
1. âœ… Build completes successfully
2. âœ… `frontend/build` directory is created  
3. âœ… Server starts without ENOENT errors
4. âœ… Your app loads at the Render URL

## Files Changed

- `package.json` - Added build scripts
- `backend/server.js` - Fixed static serving and CORS
- `frontend/src/config/api.ts` - New API configuration
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Updated to use dynamic API URL
- `frontend/src/components/MasterKeyLogin.tsx` - Updated API URL
- `frontend/src/components/MasterKeySetup.tsx` - Updated API URL
- `frontend/package.json` - Removed localhost proxy
- `render.yaml` - Deployment configuration
- `build.js` - Build script with error handling

Your deployment should now work! ðŸš€
